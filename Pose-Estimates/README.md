# Pre-computed Pose Estimates
The results from five pose estimators appear in this repository, though only three of these were used to train success-prediction networks.

Some models offer several sets of weights. Pose estimates from all sets of weights provided by the respective authors are collected here, though we only ran simulations using the pose estimates with least geometric error.
