# Pre-computed Pose Estimates
Found in this directory are the pose estimates made by the three estimators used to train success-prediction networks.

Some models offer several sets of weights. Pose estimates from all sets of weights provided by the respective authors are collected here, though we only ran simulations using the pose estimates with least geometric error.
