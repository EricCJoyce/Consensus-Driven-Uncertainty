# Pre-computed [BOP](https://bop.felk.cvut.cz/home/) Metrics for Pose Estimates
For each of our estimators, this directory contains measurements of pose estimates using metrics established by the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation (BOP).

Where several weights are provided for a model (e.g. pbr, pbrSO, SO for GDRNPP; bop20-f64, cvpr20-f256 for EPOS) all are recorded here. For our grasping trials, however, we have used the pose estimates made by the model weights that minimize rotation and translation error on the set of objects used in our study. Let each model make its best effort; give the grasping trials every reason to succeed.
